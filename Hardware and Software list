  Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 4 or similar single-board computer
- 2 DC motors with wheels
- L298N motor driver
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Microphone
- Speaker
- Servo motor
- Robot arm with gripper
- 7-inch touchscreen display

Software:
- Raspbian operating system for Raspberry Pi
- Python programming language
- OpenCV library for computer vision and image processing
- TensorFlow library for machine learning and neural networks
- PyAudio library for audio processing
- Flask web framework for building web applications
- YouTube API for integrating with the YouTube platform

With these components, you can build a basic robot that moves autonomously, recognizes voice commands, and has the ability to pick up objects with its robotic arm. The Raspberry Pi can act as the main control unit for the robot, running the necessary software and communicating with the various hardware components. The L298N motor driver can be used to control the DC motors that drive the robot's wheels, while the ultrasonic sensor can be used to detect obstacles and help the robot navigate around them.

The microphone and speaker can be used to implement voice recognition and output funny voices, while the 7-inch touchscreen display can serve as a user interface for controlling the robot and displaying information. The servo motor can be used to control the robot arm, while the gripper can be used to pick up toys and other objects.

Python is a popular programming language for robotics projects, and has a wide range of libraries and tools available for working with hardware components, processing audio and visual data, and building web applications. The OpenCV and TensorFlow libraries can be used to implement computer vision and machine learning features, while the PyAudio library can be used to process audio data.

Finally, the Flask web framework and YouTube API can be used to create a web application that allows users to control the robot remotely and activate the YouTube display feature.

Overall, these hardware and software components should be readily available for average consumers, and can be combined to create a fun and functional DIY robotics project that incorporates the key features described in the initial prompt.
